      <li>
        2020: Completed <a href="https://www.fast.ai">Fast.ai</a>'s incredible deep learning MOOC, "Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3"
        <ul>
          <li>I cannot recommend this course highly enough, you learn usable skills quickly, and the project oriented focus is super motivating!</li>
          <li>Feel free to check out <a href="/projects#ml-hot-or-cold">ML: Hot or Cold</a>, a project I built while working through the class.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>
        2017-2019: Slowly worked through Andrew Ng's introductory Coursera class on <a href="https://coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Unfortunately, I only got to week 9 of 11, but I did gain a high-level understanding of what ML methods are out there.</li>
          <li>After starting Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning course, I elected to focus my free-time energy there, instead.</li>
        </ul>
