    <h5>About me:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>In my free time I enjoy climbing, hiking, reading, and video games.</li>
      <li>I started indoor bouldering in late 2015, and it quickly became one of my favorite hobbies.
        <ul>
          <li>
            For a brief moment I could climb
            <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/climbing-bouldering-rating.html">V5 difficulty</a> routes, 
            but these days I'm typically climbing V2s and V3s. ðŸ˜…

        <ul>
          <li>I'm <a href="https://lichess.org/@/PNWchris">not very good</a>, but it's a fun challenge and a nice way to stay in touch with friends.</li>
