  <h3>Hello, World!</h3>

  Hi there, I'm Chris Jeakle. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2014 and am working as an SDE at Microsoft.<br/>

  <br/>

  <h5>About me:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>I enjoy climbing, hiking, reading, video games, and building the occasional project.</li>
    <li>I took up indoor bouldering in late 2015, and it quickly became my main hobby. I'm finally breaking back into 
      <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/climbing-bouldering-rating.html">V4</a> 
      routes after some time away from the gym!
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>What I'm up to:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>At work I'm building an SDK and developer tools. I also contribute improvements to our core product when the opportunity arises.</li>
    <li>At home I'm building some fun <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.</li>
    <li>Along with all that, I'm learning <a href="/education/">some cool new things</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Want to reach out or have a cool project in mind?</h5>
  <ul>
    <Li>Feel free to use the <a href="/about">about page</a> and send me an email.</Li>
