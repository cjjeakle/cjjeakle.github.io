  <h3>Hello, World!</h3>

  <p>
    Hi there, I'm Chris Jeakle. I studied Computer Science at the University of Michigan, and am currently working on specialized ERP software.<br/>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h5>About me:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I enjoy climbing, hiking, reading, video games, and building the occasional project.</li>
      <li>I took up indoor bouldering in late 2015, and it quickly became my main hobby. I'm finally breaking back into 
        <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/climbing-bouldering-rating.html">V4</a> 
        routes after some time away from the gym!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h5>What I'm up to:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>At work I'm building an SDK and developer tools. I also contribute improvements to our core product when the opportunity arises.</li>
      <li>At home I'm building some fun <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.</li>
      <li>Along with all that, I'm learning <a href="/education/">some cool new things</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
