  <h3>Hello, World!</h3>

  <p>
    Hi there, I'm Chris Jeakle. 
    I studied Computer Science at the University of Michigan and I currently work on high-performance networking.
    <br/>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h5>About me:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>In my free time I enjoy climbing, hiking, skiing, and reading.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite pass times is indoor bouldering. I started in late 2015 and it quickly became one of my favorite hobbies.
        <ul>
          <li>
            For a brief moment I could climb
            <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/climbing-bouldering-rating.html">V5 difficulty</a> routes, 
            but these days I'm typically climbing V2s and V3s. ðŸ˜…
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        I play chess from time to time, though I'm <a href="https://lichess.org/@/PNWchris">not very good</a>. It's a fun challenge and a great way to stay in touch with friends.
      </li>
      <li>
        I started skiing up at <a href="https://cascademountain.com/">Cascade</a> this season and had an absolute blast, I can't believe I waited so long to give it a serious try!
        <ul>
          <li>Ski lessons are a huge help, a lesson took me from terrified beginner to skiing blues in no time.</li>
          <li>After a season of skiing, now I'm doing black diamond routes regularly! Well, mid-western black diamonds, but still!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h5>What I'm up to:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>At my day job I write high-performance datacenter networking software.</li>
      <li>I'm learning <a href="/education/">some cool new things</a>.</li>
      <li>Sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly motivated, I build <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
