    <p>
      Nouncaptcha was created for my undergraduate honors thesis requirement. 
      It was an effort to create an alternative to text based CAPTCHAs, such as reCAPTCHA, and was made with modern internet-connected devices in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nouncaptcha's design makes it easy to use with either a keyboard and mouse, or with just a touchscreen.
      Creating a theoretically secure CAPTCHA with such a widely applicable design proved to be an enthralling challenge!

    <div class="row inline-header" id="SmartSync"><h4>Smart Sync</h4><h5>started in 2015</h5></div>

    <p>
      The Windows 10 mail app can take a while to sync local changes to GMail, so I created Smart Sync to make things nearly instant. 
      After some investigation, I discovered "triage" events (eg: marking as read, moving to a folder, etc) flush to the server on a schedule, and do not propagate immediately.
      Being <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job">lazy</a> at heart, I refuse to press the "refresh" button to sync my changes before switching to a web mail interface or my phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some investigation, I discovered a nifty API to access email mailboxes on my machine, listen for change events, and automatically invoke a sync. 
      I consumed the API using a Windows 10 universal app, 
      as the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.email.aspx">ApplicationModel.Email</a> namespace 
      is only available to UWP apps. The solution I created can launch the mail app, and immediately syncs local changes to the server. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I can rest assured knowing my email is synced when I switch to my phone, webmail, or a different computer.

    <p>
      Rebalance Calc is a tool to distribute a desired asset allocation among taxable and tax-advantaged accounts. 
      It is designed to optimize for <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax efficiency</a>. 
      I originally built a similar tool using excel, but found myself missing the ability to program my solution in a familiar language. 
      I also wanted the ability to separate data from presentation (my spreadsheet had quickly became a confusing mess of cells containing intermediate state).
    </p>
    <p>
      After some thought, I felt a simple web app could address my needs, and potentially the needs of many others. 
      I built the site, and have found it very useful while annually rebalancing my investment accounts.

    <div class="row inline-header" id="devbox-setup"><h4>Dev Box Setup Scripts</h4><h5>started in 2016</h5></div>

    <p>
      I generally work on projects in Ubuntu VMs, and have found it tedious to get these machines set up exactly how I like by hand. 
      This task was a perfect candidate for automation, so I created a series of scripts and pushed them to GitHub.
      Now it's quick and easy to install the software packages I rely on, set up git with GitHub public key authentication, and to properly configure an SSH server (it's as simple as ctrl-c & ctrl-v).
    </p>
    <p>
      These scripts simplify my life by making it easy to get an Ubuntu VM to a known good state. 
      They also guarantee my production and development environments have similar, if not identical (where appropriate), configurations!
    </p>

    <div class="row inline-header" id="traffic-tool"><h4><a href="https://cjjeakle.github.io/traffic-tool">Traffic Tool</a></h4><h5>started in 2016</h5></div>

    <p>
      This tool calculates a moving average of your speed, ideally providing a ballpark target speed to avoid slowing down in heavy traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I designed this tool after reading through a site likening traffic slow-downs to compressions in a longitudinal wave.
      The comparison made incredible sense.
      Based on that model, one can travel at or below their average speed across a window of traffic and smooth out the more compressed sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this project did not work as well as I had hoped.
      In heavy stop-and-go traffic it's possible the idea would work, but in more typical traffic with sporadic slowdowns your average speed changes too drastically across time intervals, and even between lanes.
      The README on GitHub has a more detailed analysis and some additional considerations for why this tool wasn't as practical as I'd have liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite not working as well as I'd hoped, I don't consider this project a failure. I had a ton of fun building it and experimenting with improving my commute, and that's what makes a project great in my mind!
