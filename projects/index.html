      <p>
        Nouncaptcha was created for my undergraduate honor's thesis requirement. 
        It was an effort to create an alternative to text based CAPTCHAs, such as reCAPTCHA, and was made with modern internet-connected devices in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CAPTCHA was designed to be easy to use with either a keyboard and mouse, or with just a touchscreen.
        Creating a theoretically secure CAPTCHA with such design constraints proved to be an enthralling challenge!

      <p>
        Rebalance Calc is a tool to distribute a desired asset allocation among taxable and tax-advantaged accounts. 
        It is designed to optimize for <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax efficiency</a>. 
        I originally built a similar tool using excel, but found myself missing the ability to program my solution in a familiar language. 
        I also wanted the ability to separate data from presentation (my spreadsheet had quickly became a confusing mess with cells containing intermediate state).
      </p>
      <p>
        After some thought, I felt a simple web app could address my needs, and potentially the needs of many others. 
        I built the site, and have found it quite useful for my fairly novice investing use case.
