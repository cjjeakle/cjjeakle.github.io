        RebalanceCalc determines what accounts should hold what investments, and specifically optimizes for <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax efficiency</a>.

        I originally built a similar tool using excel, but found the spreadsheet difficult to manage and maintain. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After some thought, I felt a simple web app could address my needs, and potentially the needs of many others. 
        I built the site, and have found it very useful while rebalancing my investments.

        Nouncaptcha was created for my undergraduate honors thesis. 
        It was an effort to create an alternative to text based CAPTCHAs, such as reCAPTCHA, and was made with mobile devices in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nouncaptcha's design makes it easy to use with either a keyboard and mouse, or with just a touchscreen.
        Creating a theoretically secure CAPTCHA with such a widely accessible design proved to be an enthralling challenge!

        I've provisioned a number of Ubuntu (and other Debian-based) machines, VMs, and WSL instances over the years. As a consequence, I've spent a lot of time getting my dev environments set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an effort to simplify things, I created a series of configuration scripts and pushed them to GitHub.
        Now it's quick and easy to install the software packages I rely on, set-up git with GitHub public key authentication, and to properly configure an SSH server.

        These projects are just the highlights! I'm often trying new ideas, but not all of them warrant a write-up here. Stop by my GitHub to take a look at other stuff I'm building.
