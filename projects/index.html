      <h4>nouncaptcha</h4>

      <p>
        Nouncaptcha was created for my undergraduate honor's thesis requirement. 
        It is an effort to create an alternative to a text based CAPTCHA (such as reCAPTCHA) that is better suited for modern internet-connected devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CAPTCHA was designed to be easy to use with either a keyboard and mouse, or with just a touchscreen.
        Creating a theoretically secure CAPTCHA with such design constraints proved to be an enthralling challenge!

      <h4>Rebalance Calc</h4>

      <p>
        Rebalance calc was made to help me with rebalancing assets among my different retirement accounts, while optimizing for <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax efficiency</a>. I originally built a similar tool using excel, but found myself missing the ability to program the solution in a familiar language and missing the ability to separate data from presentation (the spreadsheet quickly became a confusing mess of cells containing intermediate state).
      </p>

      <p>
        After some thought, I felt a simple web app could address my needs, and potentially the needs of many others. I build the site, and have found it quite useful for my fairly novice investing use cases.
