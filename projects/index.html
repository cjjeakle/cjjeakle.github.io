    <div class="row inline-header" id="rebalancecalc"><h4><a href="https://www.rebalancecalc.com">Rebalance Calc</a></h4><h5>started in 2016 & refactored in 2020</h5></div>

      <p>
        Rebalance Calc helps you keep investments (across multiple accounts) in line with a target asset allocation. 
        The tool takes <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax efficiency</a> into account, and automatically suggests the types of trades you'd make to stay in line with your target asset allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "about" button on the website provides a good summary, and the "how it works" button outlines the exact procedure the tool uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been continually improving the app, and recently finished a substantial refactor. 
        Feel free to take a look at the new features list in the GitHub README, there's a lot of cool new stuff!

    <div class="row description">
      <p>
        ML: Hot or Cold is a machine learning project that detects hot or cold water from the sound of pouring (in practical terms the model was fed data where >= 175 f was hot and <= 75 f was cold).
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is an effort to use skills from Fast.ai's excellent MOOC, and was inspired by an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/07/05/328842704/what-does-cold-sound-like">NPR piece</a> on the sound water makes when poured at different temperatures.
      <p>
        Additionally, this project is a liberally licensed example of sound classification using fastai as a wrapper around torch.
        I did some digging while working on this project, and ended up relying very little on other people's work due to licensing concerns!
        To help others, I liberally licensed this project and took a detailed log of my development process.</p>

    <div class="inline-header" id="nouncaptcha"><h4><a href="https://www.nouncaptcha.com">Nouncaptcha</a></h4><h5>started in 2014</h5></div>

    <div class="row description">
      <p>
        Nouncaptcha was created for my undergraduate honors thesis. 
        It was an effort to create an alternative to text based CAPTCHAs, such as reCAPTCHA, and was made with mobile devices in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nouncaptcha's is designed to be easy to use with either a keyboard and mouse, or just a touchscreen.
        Creating a theoretically secure CAPTCHA with such a wide variety of client devices in mind proved to be an enthralling challenge!

    <div class="row description">
      <p>
        I've provisioned a number of Ubuntu (and other Debian-based) machines, VMs, and WSL instances over the years. As a consequence, I've spent a lot of time getting my dev environments set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an effort to simplify things, I created a series of configuration scripts and pushed them to GitHub.
        Now it's quick and easy to install the software packages I rely on, set-up git with GitHub public key authentication, and to properly configure an SSH server.

        These projects are just the highlights! I'm often trying new ideas, but not all of them warrant a write-up here. Stop by my GitHub to take a look at other stuff I'm building.
