      <p>
        Nouncaptcha was created for my undergraduate honor's thesis requirement. 
        It was an effort to create an alternative to text based CAPTCHAs, such as reCAPTCHA, and was made with modern internet-connected devices in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CAPTCHA was designed to be easy to use with either a keyboard and mouse, or with just a touchscreen.
        Creating a theoretically secure CAPTCHA with such design constraints proved to be an enthralling challenge!

      <p>
        Rebalance Calc is a tool to distribute a desired asset allocation among taxable and tax-advantaged accounts. 
        It is designed to optimize for <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax efficiency</a>. 
        I originally built a similar tool using excel, but found myself missing the ability to program my solution in a familiar language. 
        I also wanted the ability to separate data from presentation (my spreadsheet had quickly became a confusing mess with cells containing intermediate state).
      </p>
      <p>
        After some thought, I felt a simple web app could address my needs, and potentially the needs of many others. 
        I built the site, and have found it quite useful for my fairly novice investing use case.

      <div class="row inline-header"><h4>Smart Sync</h4><h5>(2015)</h5></div>

      <p>
        I created Smart Sync after getting frustrated waiting for the built-in Windows 10 mail app to sync changes to the server. 
        After some investigation, I discovered "triage" events (eg: marking as read, moving to a folder, etc) flush to the server on a schedule, and do not propagate immediately.
        Being <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job">lazy</a> at heart, I refuse to press the "refresh" button to sync my work before switching to a web mail interface or my phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some investigation, I discovered a nifty API to access email mailboxes on my machine, listen for change events, and automatically invoke a sync. 
        I consumed the API using a Windows 10 universal app, 
        as the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.email.aspx">ApplicationModel.Email namespace</a> 
        is only available to UWP apps. The solution I created can launch the mail app, and immediately syncs local changes to the server. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I can rest assured knowing my email is synced when I switch to my phone or a different computer.

      <p>
        I generally work on small projects in Ubuntu VMs, and have found it tedious to get these machines set up exactly how I like by hand. 
        This task was a perfect candidate for automation, so I created a series of scripts and pushed them to GitHub.
        Now it's quick and easy to install the software packages I rely on, to set up git and GitHub public key auth, and to properly configure an SSH server (it's as simple as ctrl-c & ctrl-v).
      </p>
      <p>
        These scripts simplify my life by making it easy to get an Ubuntu VM to a known good state. 
        They also guarantee my production and development environments have similar, if not identical (where appropriate), configurations!
