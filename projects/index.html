      <p>
        In 2022, after years of hearing and reading about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rustlang</a>, I decided it was time to try using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I've only dipped my toes in. As always, I started by writing a <a href="https://github.com/cjjeakle/sudoku-rs">sudoku solver</a> (but with a fun twist, this one is parallelized and wicked fast!). 
        I'm also working on <a href="https://github.com/cjjeakle/network-monitor">a simple tool</a> to monitor latency on my home network and watch for outages.

    <div class="row description">
      <p>
        ML: Hot or Cold is machine learning model that classifies water as hot or cold from the sound of pouring (in practical terms the model was fed data where >= 175℉ was hot and <= 75℉ was cold).
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is an effort to use skills from Fast.ai's excellent MOOC, 
        and was inspired by an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/07/05/328842704/what-does-cold-sound-like">NPR piece</a> on the sound water makes when poured at different temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, this project is a liberally licensed example of sound classification using fastai as a wrapper around torch.
        I did some digging while working on this project, and ended up relying very little on other people's work due to licensing concerns!
        To help others, I liberally licensed this project and took a detailed log of my development process.

    <div class="row inline-header" id="rebalancecalc"><h4><a href="https://www.rebalancecalc.com">Rebalance Calc</a></h4><h5>started in 2016 & refactored in 2020</h5></div>
    <div class="row description">
      <p>
        Rebalance Calc helps users maintain a target asset allocation across all of their accounts. 
        The tool takes <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax efficiency</a> into consideration, 
        and automatically suggests the types of trades needed to stay in line with the target asset allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "about" button on the website provides a good use case summary, and the "how it works" button outlines the exact procedure the tool uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been continually improving this tool, and recently finished a substantial refactor. 
        Feel free to take a look at the new features list in the GitHub README, there's a lot of cool new stuff!

    <div class="inline-header" id="nouncaptcha"><h4><a href="https://www.nouncaptcha.com">Nouncaptcha</a></h4><h5>started in 2014</h5></div>
    <div class="row description">
      <p>
        Nouncaptcha was created for my undergraduate honors thesis. 
        It was an effort to build an alternative to text based CAPTCHAs, such as reCAPTCHA, with considerable focus given to ease-of-use on touch screen devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designing a usable, theoretically secure CAPTCHA proved to be an enthralling challenge!

        These projects are just the highlights! I'm often trying new ideas, but not all of them warrant a write-up here. Stop by my GitHub to take a look at other stuff I'm building.
