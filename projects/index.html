        After sitting out the late-2014 and late-2017 Bitcoin crazes, I felt some serious FOMO. I ended up buying a small amount of Bitcoin at an all-time high in December 2017, and concluded that I need a more rigorous strategy if I want to give this a shot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I set up a GDAX account (an investor-oriented platform made by Coinbase), and got to work learning the API. My plan was to build and maintain a market cap weighted portfolio of all the products GDAX supports, aiming to recreate something like VTI or SPY for crypto-currencies. I also aimed to implement a dollar-cost average buying strategy, to avoid going all-in at a less than ideal price.
      </p>
      <p>
        My GDAX automation scripts take the emotion out of crypto-currency speculation and keep things simple. I wrote code to determine the relative market cap of each GDAX product, determine my dollar-value balance for each product, and perform buys that keep my asset allocation on target. I then scheduled my buy script using crontab and Azure functions. Now I only need to manage my GDAX balance, as I'd rather not automate bank transfers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disclaimer: I'm very aware crypto-currencies are highly speculative and coin market cap is a fairly fraught metric. This project was primarily built for fun, and as a way to put only a couple dollars a month to work.

        Traffic Tool calculates a moving average of your speed, ideally providing a ballpark target speed to avoid slowing down in heavy traffic.

        It didn't work as well as I had hoped, but I had a ton of fun trying to improve my commute.

        I've created a fair number of Ubuntu and Windows Subsystem for Linux instances for projects and experiments. As a consequence, I've spent a lot of time getting machines set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an effort to simplify things, I created a series of configuration scripts and pushed them to GitHub.
        Now it's quick and easy to install the software packages I rely on, set-up git with GitHub public key authentication, and to properly configure an SSH server.

        Rebalance Calc helps you keep your retirement investments on track in your taxable and tax-advantaged accounts. 
        It is designed to optimize for <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax efficiency</a>.

        I originally built a similar tool using excel, but found myself missing the ability to program my solution in a familiar language. 
        I also wanted the ability to separate data from presentation (my spreadsheet had quickly became a confusing mess of cells containing intermediate state).
      </p>
      <p>
        After some thought, I felt a simple web app could address my needs, and potentially the needs of many others. 
        I built the site, and have found it very useful while annually rebalancing my investment accounts.

        The Windows 10 mail app can take some time to sync local changes to GMail. 
        After some investigation, I discovered "triage" events (e.g.: marking as read, moving to a folder, etc) flush to the server on a schedule, and do not propagate immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered a nifty API to access email mailboxes on my machine, listen for change events, and automatically invoke a sync. 
        
        The solution I created can launch the mail app, and immediately syncs local changes to the server while it is open.

        Being <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job">lazy</a> at heart, I refuse to press the "refresh" button to sync my changes before switching to a web mail interface or my phone. Now I can rest assured knowing my email is synced when I switch to my phone, webmail, or a different computer.

        Nouncaptcha was created for my undergraduate honors thesis requirement. 
        It was an effort to create an alternative to text based CAPTCHAs, such as reCAPTCHA, and was made with modern internet-connected devices in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nouncaptcha's design makes it easy to use with either a keyboard and mouse, or with just a touchscreen.
        Creating a theoretically secure CAPTCHA with such a widely accessible design proved to be an enthralling challenge!
